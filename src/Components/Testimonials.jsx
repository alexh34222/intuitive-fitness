              From the early stages of life, we naturally engage in activities
              like crawling, walking, and running, as well as playful movements.
              Throughout history, our ancestors relied on physical activity for
              survival, such as hunting, gathering, and farming. <br /> <br />
              In modern times, exercise remains instinctive as it releases
              endorphins, the feel-good hormones, contributing to improved mood
              and reduced stress. Whether it's dancing, playing sports, or
              simply taking a walk, our bodies are designed to be in motion.{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              The beauty of exercise is that it allows us to listen to our
              bodies, choosing activities that bring joy and fulfillment, making
              it more likely to become a sustainable and enjoyable part of our
              lives. <br />
              <br />
              Here are some clients who make Intuitive the empowering place it
              is.

            <p>
              Tom is awesome! He has been my personal trainer for over a year
              now and he has been amazing. I had a pretty serious back injury a
              couple of years ago and he has tailored my workout to both help me
              strengthen my core but also generally improve my health. He’s a
              really chill guy that is understanding of everything that is
              happening and I can not recommend him more!

            <p>
              Tom has been the reason my husband and I finally enjoy working
              out, and we never used to work out. I would highly recommend him
              to anyone looking for a well informed, easy-going, no-guilt
              trainer. Not to mention the privacy of his well set up backyard
              workout shed is a pleasure to workout in as opposed to a crowded
              gym!

            <p>
              Tom is knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. He's giving me
              new training methods and form improvements to improve my squat,
              deadlift and bench press.

              Tom is an amazing trainer - very knowledgeable and understanding.
              Getting back to shape is hard but he knows how to make it
              engaging. He knows exactly how to push you to get the best
              results.
